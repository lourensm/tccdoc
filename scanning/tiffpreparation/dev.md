* Need to define different specifications of actions on scans/tiff files.
  For now we have a test tif file "kin.tif" and we work on analysing
  scanned pages of some book.

* We need to pass on to the program how to analyse the tif file.
  For now we simply define the activities in datastructures in the source.
  But we still need an option for this.

* Analysis and cleanup of the source.
  * Let us do all actions starting from a segment.
  * How to deal with the detected "blobs"?
* Details: How to define "blob' actions?
  

TODO?


TODO: document the pixelrotationresults, start encoding the rotation, the
box. (Use imagemagick convert).

We need to have blobs available for the rotation detection later.
So the setup of callbacks should be combined.
